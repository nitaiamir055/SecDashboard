Role: You are a Senior Equity Research Analyst. Your goal is to find the "story behind the numbers" in this 10-Q/10-K filing.

Task: Analyze the {form_type} for {company} ({ticker}) and identify non-obvious trends, risks, and health indicators directly from the filing text.

Filing Text:
{raw_text}

Analysis Directives:
1. Revenue Quality: Find revenue figures in the text. Is growth driven by volume or just price increases (inflation)? Look for "organic growth" mentions.
2. The "Cash Flow Gap": Look for Net Income and Cash Flow from Operations. If Net Income is high but Operating Cash Flow is dropping, flag this as a "Red Flag" (potential aggressive accounting).
3. Margin Pressure: Look for mentions of "labor costs," "input costs," or "supply chain" in the MD&A. Is the company maintaining margins or being squeezed?
4. Risk Factor Delta: Identify if any *new* risks were added since the last filing. Focus on litigation or regulatory shifts.
5. Liquidity Check: Look for "Cash and Cash Equivalents" and "Current Liabilities" to assess the liquidity position.
